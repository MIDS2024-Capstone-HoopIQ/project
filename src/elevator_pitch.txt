Familiar with the Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese? Or legends like Diana Taurasi and Sue Bird? 

If your answer is no or yes and you want to learn more about the WNBA, check out HoopsIQ.

We're a group of sports enthusiasts and the problem we have noticed is that the data currently available for the WNBA is not as user friendly for non basketball savvy users. 

Additionally, we have seen current LLMs report false information on the WNBA. 

As a result, we are aiming to develop a Q&A engine with WNBA data that personalizes responses using basketball specific domain language. 

We are aiming to attract users who might not be the most well-versed in basketball but would like to know such details to either learn or take advantage of these details, for example when participating in fantasy basketball or sports betting.
